cd gh-load-pull-request

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Make the script executable

## Usage

```
Usage: gh-load-pull-request <pr-url> [options]

Options:
  -t, --token    GitHub personal access token (optional for public PRs)
  -o, --output   Output file path (default: stdout)
  -h, --help     Show help
  --version      Show version number
```

## Input Formats

The tool supports multiple formats for specifying a pull request:

1. **Full URL**: `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`
2. **Shorthand with #**: `owner/repo#123`
3. **Shorthand with /**: `owner/repo/123`

## Authentication

The tool supports multiple authentication methods for accessing private repositories:

### 1. GitHub CLI (Recommended)

If you have [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated, the tool will automatically use your credentials:

```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub CLI (one-time setup)
gh auth login

# Tool automatically detects and uses gh CLI authentication
gh-load-pull-request owner/private-repo#123
```

### 2. Environment Variable

Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
gh-load-pull-request owner/repo#123
```

### 3. Command Line Token

Pass the token directly with `--token`:

```bash
gh-load-pull-request owner/repo#123 --token ghp_your_token_here
```

### Authentication Priority

The tool uses this fallback chain:

1. `--token` command line argument (highest priority)
2. `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
3. GitHub CLI authentication (if `gh` is installed and authenticated)
4. No authentication (public PRs only)

## Output Format

The markdown output includes:

- **Header**: PR title
- **Metadata**: PR number, author, status, dates, branch info, stats
- **Description**: Full PR description/body
- **Commits**: List of all commits with links and authors
- **Files Changed**: All modified files with change stats
- **Reviews**: All PR reviews with approval status
- **Review Comments**: Inline code review comments with diff context
- **Comments**: General discussion comments

## Examples

# Basic usage - download and display PR
gh-load-pull-request https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28000

# Using shorthand format
gh-load-pull-request facebook/react#28000
